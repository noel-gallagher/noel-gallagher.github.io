        <h2>Two-phase commit</h2>
        <p>
          Two-phase commit is a method of executing distributed transactions.
          That is, a sequence of actions which either all succeed or fail
          entirely. Another approach is with <a href="./saga.html">sagas</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Two-Phase Commit protocol is a reliable method for ensuring the
          successful execution of transactions across all participants in a
          distributed system. This approach guarantees that actions are taken
          only when unanimous acknowledgment is received from all members within
          the distributed cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unsurprisingly, this protocol is carried out in two distinct phases:
          Prepare and Commit.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Preparation phase, the coordinator initiates a request for
          each individual node to prepare for the intended action. Each node
          then communicates its readiness to execute the transaction to the
          coordinator. If a node is incapable of executing the action, it
          signals an ABORT to the coordinator. Subsequently, the coordinator
          informs all other nodes to refrain from executing the action.
          Conversely, nodes responding with a READY signify their capability to
          proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Commitment phase, the coordinator dispatches a COMMIT message
          to every cluster member. Upon receiving this COMMIT message, each node
          executes the transaction and dispatches an acknowledgment. Should any
          participant encounter an issue, it communicates an ABORT message to
          the coordinator. The coordinator then communicates this ABORT
          directive to the remaining clients, prompting each to rollback the
          preceding transaction. Conversely, if all nodes execute the action
          successfully, the coordinator transmits a COMMIT message to each
          member, officially marking the transaction as complete.
