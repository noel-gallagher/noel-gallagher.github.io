          <h1>Apache Iceberg</h1>
          <p>
            Iceberg is a table format used to specify how tools should interpret
            data. It abstracts away the storage layer from the compute layer.
            Without such a layer, you can imagine working with raw files
            directly. Using a table format such as iceberg allows us to
            determine which files belong to a dataset. Iceberg boasts a number
            of advantages over other table formats (such as hive): how to handle
            data integrity, schema evolution, time travel/rollback and good
            performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iceberg uses a hierarchy of metadata to determine which files belong
            to a dataset, what the schema of the data is, and also how it has
            evolved over time. This hierarchy can be broken down into:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                At the top level, there is a catalog. It is used to point to the
                latest metadata file. Whenever a change is made to the table,
                the catalog creates a new metadata file and updates its
                reference to point to this new metadata file.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A metadata file can be considered as a snapshot of the table at
                a point in time. It holds the current snapshot, a list of all
                snapshots as well as the schema.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Each metadata file points to a number of manifest lists. In
                turn, each manifest list contains a number of manifest files.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A manifest file details the actual data files as well as some
                metadata about them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <p>
              The underlying storage layer for Iceberg is typically blob storage
              systems like S3, minio, or HDFS. While HDFS supports data
              appending, these storage systems are generally designed for
              immutable data storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how are files updated? They can be updated using a
              copy-on-write or a merge on read process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Copy-on-write involves copying the entire file, making the change
              then saving this as a new version. As you can imagine this is
              quite expensive when dealing with huge datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, merge on read keeps track of change and applies
              them at the time of reading. This is either through "position
              deletes" or "equality deletes"
            </p>
