          <h1>Database Durability</h1>
          <p>
            Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its
            changes are permanently stored in the database, even in the event of
            a crash. But crashes DO happen - What should happen in the event of
            a crash when a transaction is being committed? How does a database
            ensure durability in such a case?
          </p>
          <p>
            Each action can be written to disk - but this will break atomicity
            should the transaction only partially complete. Therefore, any
            transaction which begins must either complete or be rolled back.
            Databases can handle this process in different ways: two popular
            approaches are working with shadow copies/pages or a write-ahead log
            (WAL)
          </p>
          <h2>Shadow Copies/Pages</h2>
          <p>
            Shadow copies involved creating an entire copy of or part of the
            database. Should an error occur, the copy is removed. When the
            transaction completes, the old data can be replaced with the new
            data via an atomic operation (such as rename)
          </p>
          <h2>Write ahead logging</h2>
          <p>
            Write each action to a log. On crash, the unfinished transaction can
            be completed or rolled back. the WAL represents a sequence of
            actions which must be written to storage before any operation is
            executed on the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            How to optimise such a log without suffering the penalty of constant
            writes? how to use this log to recover efficiently? These are the
            questions answered by ARIES - algorithms for recovery and isolation
            exploring semantics.
            <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs345d-01/rl/aries.pdf"
              >the ARIES paper</a
            >
            describes mechanisms for transaction recovery
          </p>
          <p>
            Each log entry is structred to facilitate performance and minimise
            recovery impact. Each entry has the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Log sequence number: for ordering in a chronological fashion
            </li>
            <li>
              A transactionID: associated with the transaction responsible for
              the action
            </li>
            <li>
              A pageID: the location of the modified data. A database page is
              the minimum amount of IO possible, so this is where the data is
              located on disk.
            </li>
            <li>
              previous log sequence number: ref to the previous log of the same
              transaction
            </li>
            <li>undo: some function to undo the operation</li>
            <li>redo: some function to apply the operation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            in order to prevent these writes from becoming a bottleneck, they
            are buffered in memory. First, the query is parsed and executed,
            then the buffer pool which caches pages in memory is updated, then
            the log is updated. at some later point the log entries are flushed
            to disk. Deffering the writes in such a way allows us to take
            greater advantage of the hardware's pagesize rather than repeatedly
            wasting IOs. Later again, the buffer pool cache is written to disk.
            so why do we need a log? writing to a sequential file is less effort
            than writing to a structure is optimised for querying and reading.
