	  <p>If you have a downstream repo which shares a dependency with an upstream repo, it can be annoying to keep them in sync manually. for each new tag/version created, you will have to manually edit the downstream job.</p>
	  <p>This is a quick script outlining how to automatically bump dependencies between these kind of repos on gitlab</p>
      <p>Firstly in the upstream repo, ensure version is writen to some artifact. An artifact can persist between jobs.</p>
	  <p>Next, define a job which will trigger the downstream.</p>
	  <p>In the downstream project, add a stage, update dependency. This will perform the act of editing the dependency file, adding to vc, pushing to the repo and opening an MR.</p>
	  <p>For this you will need to create and set an access token with write and api access permissions.</p>
	  <p>Ensure to add the "needs" field which will take the artifact from the upstream job</p>
