          <h1>Database Isolation Levels</h1>
          <p>
            In databases, a transaction is a collection of operations which are
            treated as a single unit of work. Ensuring the integrity and
            consistency of data during concurrent transactions is where the 'I'
            (Isolation) property of ACID comes into play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given multiple ongoing transcations, how can we prevent interference
            between each transaction? If transaction A is running some SELECT
            query, while transaction B simultanously performs an UPDATE which
            would affect A's results, what should happen?
          </p>
          <p>
            The result depends entirely only the isolation level setting of the
            database (and also the database vendor's interpretation of this
            definition)
          </p>
          <h2>Read uncommitted</h2>
          <p>
            This level offers essentially no isolation. Transaction A can see
            the uncommitted results of transaction B. This can lead to a number
            of issues such as a "dirty read". If there's a row representing a
            user's bank balance and two transactions A and B. A BEGINs a
            transaction and performs an UPDATE to increment the balance by 200,
            meanwhile B BEGINs a seperate simultanous transaction which SELECTs
            the balance. If A rolls back, B still sees the balance as the inital
            value + 200 - meanwhile the actual balance is the intial value.
          </p>
          <h2>Read committed</h2>
          <p>
            Each query in a transaction only sees committed changes. Given two
            transactions A and B, A BEGINs and SELECTs ID 1, getting the value
            x. If B BEGINs and then UPDATEs ID 1 to x + 1 and then commits, when
            A performs another SELECT on ID 1, it will see different values.
            This is called a non-repeatable read. under either read committed or
            read uncommited, non-repeatable reads are possible
          </p>
          <h2>Repeatable read</h2>
          <p>
            For the duration of a transaction, when the row is read, the row
            will remain unchanged. This means that for two transactions A and B,
            even if B COMMITs a change to a value which A previously read, when
            A rereads that value, it will remain unchanged. However, if
            transaction A were to SELECT a range of values, perhaps calculating
            the SUM based on a specific predicate, and transaction B were to
            COMMIT a change that affects the result of this SUM operation (such
            as inserting or deleting rows within that range), transaction A
            could get different results each time it re-executes the SUM query.
            This phenomenon is known as a phantom read.
          </p>
          <h2>Snapshot</h2>
          <p>
            Each query only sees changes that have been committed up to the
            start of the transaction. like taking a snapshot of the database at
            the current moment. Even if transaction B has COMMITed changes,
            transaction A will have a consistent view of the data for the
            duration of its transaction. This prevents phantom reads but can
            lead to another issue. Should transaction B COMMIT and update to row
            X, then transaction A modifies row X - only A's change will be taken
            into account. This can lead to a "lost update"
          </p>
          <h2>Serializable</h2>
          <p>
            no transactions can run simultanously. Transaction B must follow
            transaction A
          </p>
          <p>
            Each isolation level offers different guarantees and has
            consequences on behaviour. It's important to keep in mind the
            appropriate isolation level when executing transactions.
