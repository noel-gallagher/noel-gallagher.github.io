	  <p>Actor system - controls threads, allocates to actors
Actors - actors are uniquely identified, messages passed asynchronously, each
actor may respond differently, actors are encapsulated (you cannot access
their state directly)
You can only communicate via ref
Class person(name: String) extends Actor{
override def receive = {
case “hi” => println(s“hi my name is, $name”)
}
}
How to instantiate an actor with arguments? Using props with argument eg
Props(new Person(“bob”))
Messages must be immutable and serialisable
ActorContext -> information about the actor environment. The actor system,
own actor reference (context.self) [similar to this.x in OOP]
An actor can send a message to itself (using context.self)
Actors can reply to messages - actor Alice and actor Bob:
SayHiTo(ref: ActorRef)
Alice ! SayHiTo(bob) // sends “hi” to bob
// case “hi” => context.sender() ! “My reply is: Hello!”
//sender() is same thing, when invoking the ! Method, actor sends a ref of
itself to the receiver
Deadletters is a ‘fake’ actor that takes care of messages not sent to anyone
Actors can forward messages to one another
Driver -> router -> pc
record MyMesssage(String body, ref: ActorRef)
Alice ! MyMesssage(hi, bob);
//receive method:
// case MyMesssage(body, ref) => ref forward body + “s” //keeps
original ref, modifies body to be ‘his’

Message ordering:
Race conditions?
Asynchronous?
How does it all work...

Akka actor system has a thread pool
Internally, actor has a message handler and a message queue(mailbox).
Akka schedules each actor’s execution on threads
Communicating with an actor:
sending a message -> enqueue onto actor’s mailbox (this is thread safe)
processing a message ->
a thread is scheduled to run this actor
messages are extracted from the mailbox, in order
the thread invokes the handler on each message (this could change

actor state)

at some point the actor is unscheduled

Only one thread may operate on an actor at any given time
allows us to program as if dealing with single thread
No need for locks, synchronisation since only one thread can access an
actors state at any time
processing of messages is atomic
Message deliveries:
at most once delivery (no duplicates)
message order is kept -> sending A then B, the receiver will always get A
before B (but if another actor sends a message C then it’s possible that will be
mixed in)

/system -> system guardian (manages logging and other)
/user -> user-level guardian (guardian for every user/programmer created
actor)
/ -> root guardian (manages system guardian and user-level guardian)
Actor selection:
var myActor context.actorSelection(“/user/parent/child1”);
myActor ! “Hello”
Logging:
Explicitly
val logger = Logging(context.system, this) //this is an Actor
ActorLogging
extends Actor with ActorLogging
Akka config:
config.conf
Inline config:

val configString = “””

akka {
loglevel = “DEBUG”
}
“””

val config = ConfigFactory.parseString(configString);
val actorSys = ActorSystem(“systemNam”, ConfigFactory.load(config))
Configuration by file:
create file under src/main/resources/application.conf
akka {
loglevel = DEBUG
}
Val fileConfigSystem = ActorSystem(“sys”) //will pickup the application.conf
automatically
Include some other config:
akka {
loglevel = DEBUG
}
otherconfig {
akka {
loglevel = INFO
}
}
val otherConfig = ConfigFactory.load().getConfig(“otherconfig”)
Val otherConfigSystem = ActorSystem(“otherSys”, otherConfig)
Can define config as json or other format</p>
