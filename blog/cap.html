          <h1>The Cap Theorem</h1>
          <p>
             states that there are three possible attributes to optimise for from when dealing with database systems: consistency, availability,and partition tolerance. When designing a system, developers must take these trade-offs into consideration for the system they intend to build. 
          </p>
          <p>For a system to be considered highly available, it should be able to serve requests even if affected by some kind of extreme failure. For example, in a distributed system, if we have a cluster of several nodes; should one node fail, the system will remain available as it can still serve requests from another node.</p>
          <p>Consistency can be seen as making a read request and getting the latest write. For a distributed system with multiple nodes to be considered consistent, all updates should be reflected across all nodes. For a user of the system, it should not matter which node they happen to connect to, they should get the latest data.</p>
          <p>partition tolerance - the system should be able to handle communication issues between nodes. Should a node suffer from a network issue or hardware failure, the other nodes in the cluster must remain operational. </p>
          <p>Working with distributed systems, partition tolerance is a requirement so it limits our optimisations to either Consistency + Partition tolerance OR availability + partition tolerance. This leads to systems which are classified as CP or AP. For consistency and partition tolerance, we can think of a typical relational database such as postgres. For an AP system, we can think of dynamodb or cassandra.</p>
