          <h1>Sagas</h1>
          <p>
            One of the difficulties of working on distributed systems is losing
            the ability to easily execute a "unit of work" - a set of atomic
            operations which either all happen or none happen at all. Such an
            operation can be abstracted from the developer by relying on a
            database. however in a distributed system, each service can have its
            own database, losing the luxury of a single database for atomicity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sagas are a way to implement distributed transactions while
            preventing locking (such as
            <a href="./two-phase-commit.html">2-phase commit</a>). Relying on
            locks will hinder performance and scalability. A saga allows for
            atomic operations to complete by executing a compensating action in
            the event of failure.
          </p>
          <p>Sagas can be coordinated by 'choreography' or orchestration.</p>
          <p>
            With choreography, each service works in a cooperative manner. Each
            service must be aware of its role in the saga. When a service
            executes a transaction action, it publishes an event to the next
            service. The receiving service then executes its own action and
            responds with success or failure. In the event of failure, the
            failing service sends a failure message to its requester. On receipt
            of this failing messages, the receiving service executes its own
            compensating rollback action.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, orchestration involves a centralised service
            responsiblie for managing the saga. the orchestrator sends requests
            to each of the involved services, the services perform the action
            and reply to the orchestrator. In the event of faliure, the
            orchestrator messgaes each of the involved services to perform the
            compensation/rollback process.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this approach, the workflow is somewhat simplified at the cost
            of potentially introducing a single point of failure or bottleneck
            to the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, consider a pizza ordering system consisting of
            separate microservices: an Ordering Service, a Payment Service, and
            a Kitchen Service. Implementing a saga pattern ensures consistency
            and handles potential failures during the order process
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>User places an order via ordering service</li>
            <li>Payment is processed via the payment service</li>
            <li>the order is processed by the Kitchen service</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Any of these steps could result in a failure. For each failure
            possibility, a compensating transaction must exist for rollback to
            be possible. Let's explore some possibilities:
          </p>
          <p>The payment is rejected - Set the order to failed</p>
          <p>
            The kitchen is unavailable - Refund the user, set the order to
            failed
          </p>
