      <h2>Consensus - Something we can agree on</h2>
          <p>In the realm of distributed systems, a crucial objective is the capability to withstand faults, particularly in managing node failures. In such scenarios, the systems must sustain their functionality. Achieving this goal is facilitated by consensus algorithms.</p>
          <p>
          Usually, these algorithms are implemented through a replicated state machine mechanism, which involves duplicating data across nodes and maybe utilizing a write-ahead log. </p> 
		  <p>A write-ahead log is a robust append-only data structure employed to persist each state change as a command. This guarantees that in the event of a machine failure, the system can reestablish its state by replaying the write-ahead log.</p> 
          <p>To achieve consensus, a specific value must be replicated across nodes a predefined number of times before it can be collectively accepted.</p>
