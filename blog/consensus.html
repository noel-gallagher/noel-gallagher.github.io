      <h2>Consensus - Something we can agree on</h2>
          <p>In the realm of distributed systems, a crucial objective is the capability to withstand faults, particularly in managing node failures. In such scenarios, the systems must sustain their functionality. Achieving this goal is facilitated by consensus algorithms.</p>
          <p>
          Usually, these algorithms are implemented through a replicated state machine mechanism, which involves duplicating data across nodes and maybe utilizing a write-ahead log. </p> 
		  <p>A write-ahead log is a robust append-only data structure employed to persist each state change as a command. This guarantees that in the event of a machine failure, the system can reestablish its state by replaying the write-ahead log.</p> 
          <p>To achieve consensus, a specific value must be replicated across nodes a predefined number of times before it can be collectively accepted. This agreement could be about electing a leader, committing a transaction, or making any other collective decision.</p>
<p>
There are many challenges preventing this. Distributed systems are inherently concurrent. Multiple processes can execute simultaneously. Moreover, they operate in an asynchronous environment, meaning there is no global clock, and message delivery times are not fixed. Additionally, processes can fail at any time. Distributed consensus protocols need to handle these complexities to ensure correctness and reliability.
</p>
<p>
One of the key properties of distributed consensus is termination. It ensures that every correct process will eventually decide on a value, even if it takes an indefinite amount of time. This property ensures that the consensus problem is solvable under various conditions.
</p>
<p>
The value decided upon must have been initially proposed by one of the processes. This property is called integrity and it is used to ensure against any external influence or tampering with the agreed-upon value.

Some of the more well known consensus algorithms are <a href="./raft.html">Raft</a>, Paxos and Zab (used by zookeeper)
