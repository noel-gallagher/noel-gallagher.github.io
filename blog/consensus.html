      <h2>Consensus - Something we can agree on</h2>
          <p>In the realm of distributed systems, a crucial objective is the capability to withstand faults, particularly in managing node failures. In such scenarios, the systems must sustain their functionality. Achieving this goal is facilitated by consensus algorithms.</p>
          <p>
          Usually, these algorithms are implemented through a replicated state machine mechanism, which involves duplicating data across nodes and maybe utilizing a write-ahead log. To achieve consensus, a specific value must be replicated across nodes a predefined number of times before it can be collectively accepted.
