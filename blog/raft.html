	  Raft is a consensus algorithm based on replicated state machines. It comprises a single leader and a group of followers. The leader's role is to manage requests and subsequently forward them to the followers. All members maintain a write-ahead log, utilized to persist each action as it is received. Once a majority of the followers have confirmed an action, a quorum is established, enabling the leader to commit the action to its log. Subsequently, the leader prompts each peer to apply the action to their internal state machine.
	  </p>
	  <p>A node can be in one of three states: a leader, a follower, or a candidate. In the beginning, all nodes start as followers. A node enters the candidate state if it does not recieve a heart-beat message from the leader. As a candidate, the node solicits votes from other nodes. A candidate is elected a leader if it gets a majority of votes. Once elected leader, all changes to the cluster are routed through the leader.</p>
	  <p>
	  When a client issues a command to the leader, the leader enters it in its log as an uncommited command, it then replicates the command to the followers. Once a majority of followers confirm the command, the leader commits the entry. The leader then notifies all followers that the entry has been commited, thus a consensus on the command has been reached. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Leader election is triggered by timers. There is an election timeout which determines the amount of time a follower should wait before becoming a candidate. After this timeout, an election term is started by the node which has enetered the candidate state. During this term, the candidate votes for itself and then issues requests to other nodes for voting. On receipt of these requests, if the node has not voted in this term, it will vote for the candidate which issued the request. After voting, the node resets its own election timer. 
	  </p>
	  <p>In the event of a network parition and two or more leaders are elected, when the parition is healed, the node with highest election term will become the leader. The previous leaders will rollback their log and accept the new leader's log</p>
