	  Raft is a consensus algorithm based on replicated state machines. It comprises a single leader and a group of followers. The leader's role is to manage requests and subsequently forward them to the followers. All members maintain a write-ahead log, utilized to persist each action as it is received. Once a majority of the followers have confirmed an action, a quorum is established, enabling the leader to commit the action to its log. Subsequently, the leader prompts each peer to apply the action to their internal state machine.
