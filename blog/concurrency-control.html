        <h1>Concurrency Control</h1>
        <p>
          When dealing with many processes interacting with a database, it is
          common to encounter scenarios where process A is writing to some
          record x while process B is reading from that same record x. In such
          occurances, what should be correct or expected behaviour?
        </p>
        <p>
          Pessimistic locking is one approach. This will effectively allow
          process A OR process B exclusive access to record x. During this time
          the other process which does not have access to X must wait until it
          is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimistic concurrency control. With this method, processes are free
          to read record x as they please - once ready to perform an action
          however, they will check if the value located at the memory region
          accessed during the initial read was changed. If is was, the process
          can then discard or rollback its current action and try again. This
          could be implemented using compare and swap instruction
        </p>
        <p>
          Multi-version concurrency control - this is a form of optimistic
          locking. A process takes the current version of the record x, performs
          some action and then compares the version it acquired during initial
          read with the current version.
