            Paxos is an algorithm used by distributed systems as a method of
            acheivng <a href="./consensus.html"> consensus</a>. It consists of
            three entities: proposers, acceptors and learners. A proposer is
            responsible for... proposing values to the acceptors. Acceptors,
            receive values from propsers and reply to the proposers if they
            accepted the value or not. Finally, learners are responsible for
            storing the accepted value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with simple paxos, or the synod protocol; this describes a
            way for a group of nodes to agree on a single value, a ballot is
            started by a proposer by sending a proposed value to a group of
            acceptors. This proposal is identifiable by its proposal number.
          </p>
          <p>
            An acceptor can accept or reject the proposed value. An acceptor can
            only accept at most one value. The value is accepted if and only if
            the proposal number is higher than any previous proposal number.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value is determined to be chosen once a majority or quorum of
            acceptors have accepted the proposal. this ensures consistency
