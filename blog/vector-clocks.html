          <h1>Vector Clocks</h1>
          <p>
            Vector clocks are a data structure used in distributed systems to
            track the sequence of events or updates. They allow you to determine
            the relative ordering of events in a distributed system, helping to
            establish causality and resolve conflicts in distributed data
            storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional clocks, vector clocks do not provide a real-time
            representation of the current time. Instead, they focus on ordering
            events or updates based on their logical sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vector clocks are particularly useful in scenarios where multiple
            actors (nodes or processes) can concurrently modify the same data
            value. They help ensure that updates are applied in the correct
            order, preventing conflicts and inconsistencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a distributed system using vector clocks, each actor (node or
            process) is assigned a unique identifier (ID). This ID helps in
            tracking which actor performed which operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside the actor's ID, a vector clock assigns a sequence number
            to each actor. This sequence number represents the order in which
            the actor performed its operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Riak, a distributed NoSQL database, popularized the use of vector
            clocks in its system. Riak used vector clocks to manage and resolve
            conflicts, ensuring data consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vector clocks are designed to guarantee correctness in distributed
            systems. They prevent the "last write wins" strategy, which can lead
            to incorrect results, by ensuring that updates are ordered correctly
            based on causality.
          </p>
          <p>
            One drawback of vector clocks is that they shift the complexity of
            handling conflicts and ordering updates from the database or server
            to the client or application. This means that clients need to be
            aware of vector clocks and handle conflicts appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some distributed databases, like Apache Cassandra, use the "last
            write wins" strategy instead of vector clocks. In Cassandra, the
            focus is on achieving high availability and performance, and it
            accepts that in some cases, conflicts might occur. Cassandra
            resolves conflicts by timestamping writes, and clients may need to
            implement additional logic to handle them.
