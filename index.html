              <h2>Database Replication Strategies</h2>
              <p>
                Database replication exists to keep many copies of a database on
                different (maybe even geographically different) machines. This
                is beneficial for example to achieve high availability via
                redundancy, improved performance by offsetting read/write load
                from a single server to multiple.

              <h2>Database Durability</h2>
              <p>
                Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its
                changes are permanently stored in the database, even in the
                event of a crash. But crashes DO happen - What should happen in
                the event of a crash when a transaction is being committed? How
                does a database ensure durability in such a case?

              <h2>Database Isolation Levels</h2>
              <p>
                In databases, a transaction is a collection of operations which
                are treated as a single unit of work. Ensuring the integrity and
                consistency of data during concurrent transactions is where the
                'I' (Isolation) property of ACID comes into play. Given multiple
                ongoing transcations, how can we prevent interference between
                each transaction? If transaction A is running some SELECT query,
                while transaction B simultanously performs an UPDATE which would
                affect A's results, what should happen?

              <h2>Onion Architecture and the like</h2>
              <p>
                Adding new functionality to an ever evolving piece of a software
                is challenging. Different approaches to design and architecture
                have evolved to try and tackle this complexity; n-tier, ports
                and adapters/hexagonal, onion and others. These methods aim to
                reduce the need to change large portions of the application when
                introducing changes which affect only a portion of the system.
                Ultimately, the idea is isolating business logic in order to
                make it independent of technology choices. as a consequence,
                this makes the system more maintainable, scalable and testable
                by default.

              <h2>Sagas</h2>
              <p>
                One of the difficulties of working on distributed systems is
                losing the ability to easily execute a "unit of work" - a set of
                atomic operations which either all happen or none happen at all.
                Such an operation can be abstracted from the developer by
                relying on a database. however in a distributed system, each
                service can have its own database, losing the luxury of a single
                database for atomicity
